In addition, we have more than one commercial agency from international companies with regard to trade in Real state , Property management, tourism industry and online ecommerce LMS.
      We are proud of all the work teams within the company. We consider that the human staff is the secret of our success and the image that is embedded in the minds of our clients, whether it comes to administrators, drivers or the rest of the workers in the various departments of the company, so we were keen to define strict standards during employment in the company, so we required the most substantial evidence. And long experiences, and we made sure to link with continuous training as a way to keep abreast of the developments in the profession."
